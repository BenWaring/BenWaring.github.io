			<p onclick="myFunction(this, 'yellow')">Specifically I worked on the design and look of the game. I created the model for the main bomber and the game environment including lighting and the aestethic. We created the game in Unity. The game is in a very basic stage however, we were invited to the university showcase where the group won "Best Military Exhibit" out of the entire showcase.</p>
