			<p onclick="myFunction(this, 'yellow')">Specifically I worked on the design and look of the game. I created the model for the main bomber and the game environment including lighting and the aestethic. We created the game in Unity. The game is in a very basic stage however, we were invited to the university showcase where the group won "Best Military Exhibit" out of the entire showcase.</p>

			<p onclick="myFunction(this, 'yellow')">I created an RTS game as I thought this would stand out, using the theme of backwards I created an RTS with a mechanic of reverting backwards through time instead of advancing through ages. This was done over time instead of player choice. This way the game was focuessed more on rushing and hording resources to have the advantage rather than taking your time(as you had very little of it.), The game is in a prototype stage with the main mechanics working. The game was made on Unity and the textures and models are placeholder. Link to the Design Document: <a href="PDF/Falling Nations.pdf"><u>RTS Game</u></a></p>
